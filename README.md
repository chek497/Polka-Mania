# Polka-Mania
This website was created for a semester long project in my webpage design and development class at UNC Charlotte. My partner was Robert Rexode. The website itself provides all the information and content for a new fake music festival called Polka-Mania that is based on the Czech dance style of Polka.
This application was written using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing Jquery and Jquery packages for extra features and ease of use.
